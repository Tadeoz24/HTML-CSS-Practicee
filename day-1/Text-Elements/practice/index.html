    <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
    <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    <p>      
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type <br>
    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
    but also the leap into electronic <br> typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>    
    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with  <br> 
    desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <h1><em>Cascading Style Sheets</em></h1> 
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup <br> language like HTML. <br>
    
    <br> CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. <br>
    <br> The name <em>cascading</em> comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular <br>
     element. This cascading <b>priority</b> scheme is predictable.
